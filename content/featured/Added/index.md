Why should you switch from manually handling your restaurantâ€™s operations to an automated POS system? Well to answer this question in a nutshell, a POS system does much more than it is possible to achieve manually. It does not only record sales, but it also records all details about tax amount, discount rate(if any). Table management in restaurants becomes much more efficient when done digitally. Information stored in the POS system can then be accessed by the authorized personnel.
